# hello-discord-bot

A fun little discord bot that says hello when you say hello, in a bunch of fun languages.

My first discord bot!

## Get started!

1. Download the code.
2. To use this little dude, pop over [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), and make a new app. Then make a bot.
3. Get your token, and paste it into bot.js for the variable `token`.
4. Now, just go to this link in your browser (add your client ID!):  
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id={CLIENT ID!}&scope=bot&permissions=14336`  
5. `npm i --save discord.js`
6. `npm bot.js`.
7. Go to discord and say "Hello!"

It should do this:

Enjoy your friendly bot!
